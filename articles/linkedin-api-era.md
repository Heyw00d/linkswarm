# The End of "There's An App For That"

*LinkedIn Article Draft - Chris Gale*

I've been building software for 15 years. And I'm watching the entire industry model flip upside down.

Remember "there's an app for that"? Every problem got its own subscription. Your own dashboard. Someone else's opinion of what you need to see.

We accumulated dozens of logins. Monthly bills. Dashboards we barely used because they showed 100 things when we only cared about 3.

**That era is ending.**

Here's what I've noticed building LinkSwarm over the past year:

The most sophisticated users don't want my dashboard. They want my data.

They want an API endpoint. A JSON response. Something they can pipe into their own system—whether that's a spreadsheet, a custom dashboard, or an AI agent running on their laptop.

They're not asking "what features do you have?"

They're asking "can I get the raw data out?"

---

Think about how weird that is.

A decade ago, you sold software by making the interface prettier. Better charts. More features. Smoother onboarding.

Now the interface is almost a liability.

Because the moment you design a dashboard, you're making decisions for the user. What metrics matter. How they're grouped. What they see first.

And every user has different needs.

My friend runs a marketing agency. He uses 11 different SaaS tools.

Last month he hired a developer for 2 weeks. Not to build an app. To build *his* dashboard. One screen that pulls from all 11 APIs and shows exactly what he needs—nothing more.

He canceled 3 subscriptions after that. Didn't need the dashboards anymore. Just the data pipes.

---

This is where we're headed:

**Old model:** You subscribe to software. You learn their interface. You adapt your workflow to their features.

**New model:** You subscribe to data. You pull what you need. Your interface is whatever you want it to be.

APIs aren't a "developer feature" anymore. They're the product.

The dashboard is just a demo.

At LinkSwarm, we build backlink exchange infrastructure. The natural instinct was to build a beautiful dashboard. Track your links. See your network. Charts and graphs.

We built the API first instead.

And something interesting happened: Our most active users don't log into the dashboard. They have agents—AI systems—calling our API automatically. Checking for opportunities. Requesting links. Monitoring placements.

No human in the loop.

---

This changes how you build software:

1. **API-first architecture** — The interface is optional
2. **JSON everything** — Humans can read dashboards, machines need structured data
3. **Simple auth** — API keys, not OAuth flows
4. **Webhooks for events** — Let users react to changes their way

The dashboard becomes a reference implementation. A way to show what's possible. Not the product itself.

---

I think we're entering the "give me the data" era.

People don't want another app. They want access.

Access they can plug into their existing systems. Access their AI assistant can use. Access that fits *their* workflow, not yours.

The companies that figure this out will win the next decade.

The ones still building dashboards will wonder why nobody logs in.

---

What's your take? Are you seeing this shift too?
