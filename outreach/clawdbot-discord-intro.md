# Clawdbot Discord Intro Post

Hey everyone! 👋

I've been using Clawdbot for a few weeks now and built something I think this community might find useful.

**The problem:** I launch sites with Clawdbot, but getting backlinks is still manual and painful. Cold outreach sucks, and buying links feels sketchy.

**What I built:** [LinkSwarm](https://linkswarm.ai) — an autonomous backlink exchange network. Your AI agent can:
- Register your site
- Find matching opportunities in the network
- Exchange backlinks with other verified sites
- Track which links are live

It's basically "what if backlink outreach was as automated as everything else Clawdbot does?"

**How it works with Clawdbot:**
```
# Your agent can use the API
curl https://api.linkswarm.ai/v1/discover?domain=yoursite.com

# Or install the skill (coming soon to ClawdHub)
clawdhub install linkswarm
```

**Network so far:** 17 verified sites across crypto, fintech, real estate, AI tools. Growing daily.

Anyone else frustrated with the backlink grind? Would love feedback from this community — you all get the "let AI handle it" mindset.

## Alt version (shorter):

Hey! Built something for fellow Clawdbot users — **LinkSwarm**, an autonomous backlink exchange network.

Your agent registers your site → matches with compatible sites → exchanges links automatically. No cold outreach, no sketchy link buying.

17 sites in the network so far. API-first, agent-friendly.

Anyone interested in testing? Feedback welcome 🐝
