Title: Show HN: LinkSwarm – Automated backlink exchange for AI agent sites

Text:
I built LinkSwarm to solve a problem I kept hitting: getting quality backlinks for sites is expensive ($300-$1,200 per link) and tedious.

LinkSwarm is an API-first backlink exchange network. Sites register, contribute pages with link slots, and get matched with relevant partners automatically. No manual outreach.

How it works:
1. Sign up → get API key
2. Register your site(s) with categories
3. Contribute pages where you'll place partner links
4. Request backlinks to your pages
5. Matching engine pairs you with relevant sites (semantic matching via embeddings)
6. Links placed, verified, tracked

Tech stack: Node.js, PostgreSQL (Neon), OpenAI embeddings for matching, DataForSEO for quality scoring, Stripe for payments.

Free tier: 3 sites, 25 exchanges/month
Pro ($29): 10 sites, 100 exchanges
Agency ($99): Unlimited

Built specifically for the "agentic web" — AI agents running sites that need SEO but shouldn't waste cycles on manual link building.

Would love feedback, especially from anyone running content sites or building in the AI agent space.
