## Google Compliance & Safety

LinkSwarm Premium Placements are designed to stay within Google's quality guidelines:

### How We Stay Safe

| Risk | Our Mitigation |
|------|----------------|
| **Paid link detection** | Contextual placement in real editorial content — not sidebars, footers, or "sponsored" sections |
| **Unnatural patterns** | Maximum 2 links per site pair per year; natural velocity (1-2/week max) |
| **Low-quality sites** | All premium sites verified: DA 50+, real traffic, quality content |
| **Link schemes** | No reciprocal links, no PBN patterns, no doorway pages |
| **Anchor spam** | Natural anchor text guidance; no exact-match keyword stuffing |

### What Makes This Different from "Buying Links"

Traditional link buying involves:
- Cold outreach to random sites
- Links placed anywhere (footers, sidebars)
- No quality verification
- No protection if links disappear
- Often from PBNs or hacked sites

LinkSwarm Premium Placements:
- Curated marketplace of verified publishers
- Editorial integration (in-content only)
- Quality scoring with transparency
- 90-day protection with refunds
- Publishers who actively want to participate

### Disclosure Policy

Sites in the premium network agree to:
- Place links naturally within relevant content
- Not use `rel="sponsored"` or `rel="nofollow"` (defeats purpose)
- Maintain quality editorial standards
- Keep links live for minimum 90 days

> **Note:** Like all link building, Premium Placements carry some risk. We minimize it through quality controls, but no method is 100% guaranteed. Use alongside organic SEO for best results.
