A futuristic terminal interface floating in dark space, with glowing amber/honey colored code streaming through it. On one side, a complex maze of browser windows and clicking cursors (greyed out, frustrated). On the other side, a clean single API call arrow hitting a target. The terminal should have a bee/hexagon motif subtly integrated. Style: dark mode, cyberpunk, minimalist, professional. Colors: deep purple/navy background, honey/amber accents.
